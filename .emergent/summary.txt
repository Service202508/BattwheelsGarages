<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a pixel-perfect, production-grade, full-stack website for Battwheels Garages, an EV-only, onsite roadside assistance company. The project scope is extensive and detailed in multiple major briefs provided by the user.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Abridged from User's Detailed Brief):**
1.  **Core Positioning:** The website must position Battwheels as India's #1 EV After-Sales Infrastructure Partner, focusing on a No towing first, diagnose and repair onsite model. The primary target audience is B2B (EV Fleets, OEMs).
2.  **Tech Stack:** React/Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
3.  **Frontend:**
    *   Modern, responsive, mobile-first UI.
    *   **Pages Required:** Home, About, Services (Master & Detail), Fleet & OEM Programs, Battwheels OS, Industries, Subscription Plans, Blog (List & Post), Careers, Contact, Book Service, Fleet/OEM Enquiry, FAQ.
    *   **Key UI Elements:** A premium, conversion-focused hero section, clear CTAs, and EV-centric imagery.
4.  **Backend:**
    *   REST APIs for all forms (Service Booking, Fleet Enquiry, Contact, Careers).
    *   Database integration to store all submissions.
    *   Email notifications for new submissions.
    *   File uploads for CVs on the Careers page.

6.  **SEO & Content:** Implement SEO best practices and ensure dynamic content is managed from the admin dashboard.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A visually rich frontend with over 15 pages is in place. The backend is now fully implemented with a robust set of features: MongoDB persistence for all forms, SMTP email notifications (logged to console in dev), and S3-compatible file uploads for the careers page. A complete, secure, JWT-based backend for an admin dashboard has been built, providing full CRUD APIs for Bookings, Enquiries, Services, Blogs, Testimonials, and Jobs.

The frontend has undergone several significant enhancements this session: multiple hero section redesigns, addition of a dynamic testimonials section, social/WhatsApp integration in the footer, and an Operational Cities list. The public-facing pages, however, still use mock data files, and the admin dashboard UI is only partially built (layout and login page exist).

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing the user's latest request to redesign the hero section. The task involves restructuring the hero into a full-width, two-column layout: text content on the left and the Battwheels Difference card on the right.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: (P0) Complete Hero Section Redesign:** The agent was in the middle of implementing a two-column hero layout as per the user's last detailed brief.
-   **Issue 2: (P1) Remaining Linting Errors:** Several non-critical linting errors related to unescaped characters (e.g., apostrophes) exist across multiple components from the previous session.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Complete Hero Section Redesign**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started the implementation by creating a plan but was forked before making code changes for this specific redesign.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Modify  to implement a two-column flex layout.
        2.  Move the main headline and sub-headline to the left column.
        3.  Move the Battwheels Difference card (process flow, stats, CTAs, trust badges) into the right column.
        4.  Adjust the container to be a full-width rectangle with rounded corners and a refined background gradient mesh.
        5.  Ensure the layout is responsive, stacking vertically on mobile/tablet.
        6.  Verify with the  tool.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To align the hero section with the user's latest UI/UX requirements for a more professional and structured presentation.

        2.  Manually edit the reported files to replace single quotes within JSX with  or use double quotes for the string.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To improve code quality and prevent potential rendering issues.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED

    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional admin dashboard for the Battwheels team to manage all website content.

-   All public-facing pages (, , etc.) still rely on static mock data and must be refactored to fetch data from the backend APIs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly engaged and provides extremely detailed, prescriptive briefs for UI/UX changes. Adhere to these briefs closely.
-   The backend is now feature-complete for the core requirements, including the admin panel. The next major phase is to connect the existing frontend pages to this backend and build out the admin UI.
-   The hero section is a frequent focus of user requests. The latest request is to change the layout to a two-column design. This is the immediate P0 task.
-   Treat brand assets (logo, colors) as locked. The user has approved the current logo and color scheme.

-   **Mocked:**
    -   All dynamic content on the public-facing site (Services, Blog posts, Testimonials, etc.) is still hardcoded in mock data files, despite the backend APIs now being available to serve this data dynamically.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **SMTP (for email):** Configured via environment variables, currently logs to the console.
-   **S3-compatible Storage (for file uploads):** Configured via environment variables.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: YES. A backend test suite was run via the agent and passed (13/13 tests).
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: YES. Successfully identified and helped fix a frontend rendering crash.
-   Test files created: A temporary test script was created by the testing agent, but no permanent test files () were created.
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin User:**
    -   Email: 
    -   Password: 
    -   Login URL:  (once the app is running)

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has not yet connected the public-facing frontend pages (Services, Blog, etc.) to the new backend APIs. The frontend still uses mock data.
-   The minor linting errors from the initial handoff remain unresolved.</analysis>
