**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A visually rich frontend is in place with multiple, highly-customized sections. The backend is feature-complete with a robust, JWT-secured admin dashboard providing full CRUD APIs for all content types (Services, Blogs, Bookings, etc.). Public, unauthenticated API endpoints have been created to serve content to the frontend.

The Admin Dashboard UI has been built with placeholder pages for all modules, and the login/data-fetching functionality is working. The frontend has been partially connected to the backend APIs for services, blogs, and testimonials, but currently falls back to mock data as the database is empty. The agent has implemented several user-requested UI redesigns, including a two-column hero section, futuristic stats cards, and updated EV category images. SEO preparations have begun with the addition of  and basic schema.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was tasked with fetching, optimizing, and adding official brand logos for a list of 15 EV companies to the We Serve These EV Brands section. The agent identified the relevant component and planned to create high-quality text-based SVG logos as a workaround since it cannot download images from the web.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Linting Errors:** A project-wide ESLint configuration is missing, causing linting to fail. This is a recurring issue from the previous fork and was part of the user's most recent request but has not been resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Linting warnings for unescaped characters.
-   **Recurrence count:** 2
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, ,  for SEO.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB ( driver).
-   **Authentication:** JWT for securing admin routes; separate public routes for general content.
-   **State Management:**  and  for fetching API data and managing loading/error states.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes to the database schema. The agent interacted with , , , and other existing collections.

**changes in tech stack**
-   : Added to the frontend for managing page head content (titles, meta tags).

**All files of reference**
-   **Last worked on:** 
-   **Key new/updated files:**
    -   : Contains new public APIs for services, blogs, etc.
    -   : Centralizes frontend API call logic.
    -   , , : Updated to fetch data from the backend.
    -   : Updated to fetch testimonials.
    -   : The newly created admin UI pages.
    -   : Redesigned multiple times per user requests.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Mock Data Removal:** Components updated to fetch API data still contain fallback logic to use mock data. This should be removed once the backend connection is fully tested and stable.
-   **Admin CRUD Forms:** The admin pages are currently read-only. They require forms and submission logic to be built to enable Create, Update, and Delete operations.
-   **ESLint Configuration:** The project needs a proper  or  file to be created and configured so that linting can run successfully.

**key api endpoints**
-   **New Public Endpoints:**
    -   
    -   
    -   
-   **Verified Admin Endpoints:**
    -   
    -   
    -   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and provides prescriptive briefs. Follow them closely.
-   The current P0 task is to implement the brand logos section. The previous agent planned to create text-based SVGs. You should proceed with this plan or, if capable, attempt to source real vector logos as originally requested.
-   The next critical task is to fully test the frontend-backend connection. This requires **populating the database with sample data** using the admin dashboard to ensure pages display dynamic content correctly.
-   The project has a recurring technical debt: a broken linting setup. This needs to be fixed by creating a proper ESLint configuration file.
