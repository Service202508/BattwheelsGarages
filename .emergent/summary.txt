<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to build a production-grade accounting ERP system, Battwheels OS, cloning Zoho Books. This has evolved into a complete and exhaustive migration of all features from the Zoho Books API v3 into Battwheels OS.

Recently, the user has shifted focus to significant UI/UX enhancements. This includes:
1.  A complete redesign of the login page to a premium, 3D aesthetic.
2.  A comprehensive UX/UI audit of the entire application to identify and fix inconsistencies.
3.  A request to fix layout sizing issues, content overflow on pages, and numerical data overflowing from KPI cards.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack ERP system with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database. It has numerous modules for sales, procurement, inventory, and finance.

Key recent updates include:
-   **100% Zoho Module Coverage:** All 28 Zoho Books modules are now implemented in the backend, including recently added , , and .
-   **Revamped Navigation:** The main application sidebar has been completely restructured based on a UX/UI audit. It now features a cleaner, more organized layout with collapsible sections, reducing the original 60+ items to ~8 logical groups. A new standardized  component has been created.
-   **Redesigned Login Page:** The login page has been completely overhauled with a premium aesthetic, featuring 3D animated vehicle icons, glass-morphism effects, gradient text, and improved form elements.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was actively auditing application pages to address the user's latest request to fix UI/UX layout and sizing issues. Specifically, the agent was investigating pages with KPI cards where large numerical values were overflowing their containers and pages where content required scrolling to be fully visible. The agent was viewing  and  to understand the card layouts.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent (After implementing fixes, use the testing agent to navigate through all major pages and verify that layouts are responsive and that no content or data overflows on different screen sizes. Pay special attention to the Dashboard and pages with KPI cards.)
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Content Overflow in KPI Cards and Page Layouts (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
    -   **Description:** On several pages, particularly the Dashboard, large numerical values are overflowing their KPI card containers. Additionally, some pages have layout issues where content is not fully visible without scrolling, indicating a need for better responsive design and layout management.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started investigating the  and  components to understand their structure but has not yet implemented any fixes.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Identify all pages with KPI cards (, , , , ).
        2.  Inspect the CSS for these cards. The issue is likely related to  being too large for the container, or a lack of responsive font sizing/word wrapping.
        3.  Implement a fix, potentially using  or  for the numbers and ensuring containers can grow or text can wrap. Use responsive breakpoints (e.g., ) to adjust font size.
        4.  Review pages like the Dashboard to see why scrolling is required. It may be due to fixed heights on containers or insufficient use of flexbox/grid for layout.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this will resolve major visual bugs, improve the professional appearance of the application, and enhance the overall user experience by ensuring data is presented clearly and layouts are clean.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete UX/UI Audit Fixes (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue the work from Last working item by implementing fixes for the KPI card overflow and general page layout issues.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A polished, visually consistent, and user-friendly application interface that meets enterprise-ready standards.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**

    -   **Add Loading Skeletons:** Replace generic spinners with content-aware loading skeletons for a better perceived performance.
-   **Task 2 (P1): Implement Standardized Page Headers Across All Pages:** The new  component has been created. It now needs to be implemented on all main pages (e.g., , , , etc.) to ensure a consistent look and feel.
-   **Task 3 (P2): Code Cleanup & Deprecation:** As per the original handoff, physically delete the now-redundant files to prevent future confusion:

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Priority Shift:** The primary focus has shifted from backend feature implementation to frontend UI/UX polish. Your immediate task is to fix the layout and overflow issues reported by the user.
2.  **Use the Audit Report:** A detailed UX/UI audit was performed (see message #240). Use its recommendations (e.g., standardizing cards, creating empty states, improving mobile layouts) to guide your next steps after fixing the immediate overflow bugs.
3.  **Component-Driven Approach:** Continue the pattern of creating standardized components (). When fixing the KPI card issue, consider creating a reusable  component to ensure consistency and easier future maintenance.
4.  **Navigation is Done:** The main sidebar navigation structure in  has been completely overhauled and approved. Do not make major changes to it, but focus on the content within the pages themselves.
